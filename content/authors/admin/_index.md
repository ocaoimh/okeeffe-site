I'm a specialist in Learning & Development with 15 years' experience in the education and technology sectors. I love being able to design, create and produce engaging solutions for learners. To do this, I combine technology with the most relevant insights and practices from education and research.  I have worked with top business schools, universities and corporations to evaluate and deploy learning and development strategies. I have a PhD in learning technologies and regularly publish on learning and assessment technologies.
