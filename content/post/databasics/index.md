## Data manipulation with R
One of the side projects I've been working on recently has been how to put together helpful resources and tutorials for learning designers, teachers, or educators who want to use large datasets to analyse or reflect on learning. Specifically, how to present these ideas to people who don't have a background in computer science or statistics. 

This is still a work in progress, but in the meantime, here's a brilliant post on data manipulation in R from guru99. It's clear and very helpful.
